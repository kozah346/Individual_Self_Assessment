# Individual_Self_Assessment

## Self-Assessment
* During each segment delivarable, my group of 4 members equally split roles and it varied from week to week. 
* For those tasks that did not need live discussions, we utilized the Slack communication channel and also created a message group chat as a secondary form of communication. One would explain the changes they have just made so that every group member stays in the loop. 
* In my opinion, the greatest challenge was the technical aspect of the challenge in the sense that we had to apply a variety of tools that we had learnt over the bootcamp to this dataset.

## Team Assessment
* As mentioned before, Slack was the primary form of communication and at times a message group chat. We also had  live sessions every Tuesday and Thursday 1hr before class and another live session on the weekend for 1hr in which we would discuss where we were at and if there are any personal challenges that we ran into as far as the project was concerned.
* The strengths of this team were communicating when we were not agreeing on a certain aspect. Hearing out another team member's idea before cutting them short really helped the team reach towards amicable solutions and we were able to smoothly complete the project.

## Summary of the project
* Our project was about how various food environment variables affect the obesity rate of a population. The machine learning model used in our project was the Random Forest Regressor. We realized that expenditure per capita at full service restaurants contributed the most to the obesity rates of a population.
